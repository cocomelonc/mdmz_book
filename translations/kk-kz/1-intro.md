This book is dedicated to my wife, Laura, and my children, Yerzhan and Munira. Also, thanks to everyone who is helping me through these difficult times. I will use the proceeds from the sale of this book to treat Munira and contribute to charity funds in Kazakhstan:

Now we are better, but we are still continuing treatment.    

May Allah, Lord of the Worlds, heal my daughter.     

This book is a new version of **MD MZ - Malware Development Book** - 2024 edition.     

I also plan to publish this version of the book, in sha Allah.

More than two years have passed since then, and I wanted to supplement the book with new articles from my blog. As a result, this new edition of this book now contains almost 1000 pages.
